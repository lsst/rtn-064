We are also looking into continuing support from the support scientists inside the summit operation group, especially at the beginning of the survey during which debugging and optimization might be happening more often. ","The added resources have been reviewed by an internal committee. Though tight, the lead OS is confident we will be able to begin commissioning successfully.

Rather than assess concerns with the transfer to NOIRLab in a general way, we are talking to ADs, teams, and individuals about their roles in Operations. The Director and RSO AD have visited Chile specifically to engage with staff. In August we spoke with 3 teams, the site manager, engineers, and other staff. We debriefed the Project Manager and will continue this approach through the transition period. Transition is a primary topic of the October 2024 NMOC meeting in Chile for Rubin. The Director and AD are engaging with NOIRLab leadership and ES leadership directly on transition issues.

In October, the Director initiated team-by-team communications about the transition. More communications will occur throughout FY25.

It is not useful to put this in the risk register at this point. We are actively working on staff concerns."
