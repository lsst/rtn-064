Maintenance plans are continually being updated as specific details are learned during the final test and verification action phase for the instrument.  These details are being folded into the Rubin Observatory Operations (ROO) strategic maintenance plan and include reassessment of both technical and personnel resource needed to maintain LSSTCam through the 10-year LSST program.  The ROO Strategic Maintenance PLan do men tis a key deliverable for FY23 and will be a featured discussion point in subsequent reviews.","Blum and Marshall met with Camera team in November at SLAC to discuss maintenance and OPS supports needs.

PREOPS-3519,OO-III.1-2,"Re-consider the on-site presence",JOR_2023_02,2023-10-01,"Not Started","Re-consider the on-site presence of engineering and technical support staff during nighttime for the first years of operations, until steady-state operation with nominal unplanned downtime has been reached [by FY 2024].","As the construction project progresses through its commissioning phase it is clearly evident that significant technical presence will be needed in the early stages of operations.  The Rubin Observatory Operations (ROO) plan as presented is for steady state with a minimal technical presence needed at the summit.  We have always planned that there would be a transition period between the end of construction and steady state operations.  The details of the needed technical staff during nighttime operations is becoming clearer as the construction commissioning advance.  Adjustment are currently being made in the detailed transition plan for nighttime support.

With the need for Technicalical support in mind we are also training up the nighttime Observing Specialists to have some level of technical awareness and expertise to serve as the front line for diagnosis and solving technical issues as they arise.  This is a core part of the Observing Specialists functions and has been part of the plan from the beginning.  The technical training of the Observing Specialists is part of  the designed work scope during construction commissioning.","This has been reconsidered and it is acknowledged that experience gained from the current commissioning phase of the Construction project is informing Operations on night time support that will be needed initially in operations until steady state."

PREOPS-3518,OO-III.1-1,"Monitor the effectiveness of the initial maintenance strategy",JOR_2023_02,2023-10-01,"Not Started","Monitor the effectiveness of the initial maintenance strategy during the first 2 years of operation and adjust the strategy accordingly if needed. Reserve corresponding resources in the operations plan [by FY 2024].","As part of the Rubin Construction integration, test and commissioning effort the Rubin Observatory Operations (ROO) team its carefully monitoring the maintenance needs of the observatory.  As systems are being integrated and tested the ROO team as part of their construction/operations dual responsibilities are documenting technical issues and noting specific maintenance needs.  These will be recorded in the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) under development by the construction project.  This body of information is currently being used to update the maintenance strategy and planning with resultant resources needed on various timescales.

The ROO Strategic Maintenance Plan is a key deliverable from the FY23 early operations efforts.  This document is being developed now with contributions from the ROO Team and Group leads (who are also part of the Rubin construction team).  Staffing and non-labor resource adjustments are expected from the Maintenance Strategic Plan update and will be part of revised operations planning for ROO in FY24.","This has been started and findings are being recorded in the CMMS"
